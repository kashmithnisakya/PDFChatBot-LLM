# Jac-Lang Chatbot with Streamlit Interface

## Overview
This project utilizes Jac-Lang, a language similar to Python, to create a chatbot interface powered by Streamlit. The chatbot is designed to analyze the content of multiple PDF files provided by the user and engage in conversation about the contents. It interfaces directly with state-of-the-art language models such as those from OpenAI or Hugging Face.

## Features
- **Jac-Lang Integration:** Jac-Lang, a Python-like language, serves as the backbone for the chatbot's functionality.
- **Streamlit Interface:** Streamlit is used to create an interactive web interface for the chatbot, allowing users to easily upload PDF files and engage in conversation.
- **PDF Analysis:** The chatbot analyzes the content of uploaded PDF files and can discuss various topics found within.
- **Integration with Language Models:** The chatbot is connected to advanced language models from OpenAI or Hugging Face, enabling natural and engaging conversations.

## Usage
1. **Installation:** Ensure you have Python and the necessary dependencies installed. You can install them using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
2. **Running the Chatbot:** Run the Streamlit app by executing `streamlit run jac_app_run.py` in your terminal.
3. **Interacting with the Chatbot:** Once the app is running, open the provided URL in your web browser. Upload one or multiple PDF files, and the chatbot will initiate conversation based on the content.
